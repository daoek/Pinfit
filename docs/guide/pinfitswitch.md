# `@PinfitSwitch`

Writing one `case` per enum member by hand is tedious and goes stale the moment the enum grows.
Inside any user region you can tag a `switch` with a `@PinfitSwitch` comment and let Pinfit keep the
cases in sync instead.

## Tag an empty switch

Write the comment directly above your own `switch`, naming the enum type:

```c
/*@Pinfit usercode+ function.dispatch_opcode.body*/
/*@PinfitSwitch flash_opcodes_t*/
switch (opcode)
{
}
/*@Pinfit usercode-*/
```

Run `pinfit generate`. Pinfit resolves `flash_opcodes_t` (see [Resolving the enum](#resolving-the-enum)
below) and rewrites the switch with one `case` per member plus a `default`, each carrying its own
nested user region:

```c
/*@PinfitSwitch flash_opcodes_t*/
switch (opcode)
{
    case FLASH_OP_READ:
    {
        /*@Pinfit usercode+ switchcase.flash_opcodes_t.FLASH_OP_READ*/
        /*@Pinfit usercode-*/
        break;
    }
    case FLASH_OP_WRITE:
    {
        /*@Pinfit usercode+ switchcase.flash_opcodes_t.FLASH_OP_WRITE*/
        /*@Pinfit usercode-*/
        break;
    }
    default:
    {
        /*@Pinfit usercode+ switchcase.flash_opcodes_t.default*/
        /*@Pinfit usercode-*/
        break;
    }
}
```

From then on, edit only inside the `switchcase.<enum>.<case>` regions. They survive regeneration
like any other user region, and **a new enum member automatically gets its own empty case** on the
next run. Removing a member works the other way round: if its case region still holds code,
generation fails and names that case, so you can move or delete the code first. An empty case is
removed without asking.

!!! warning "The skeleton is Pinfit's now"

    Anything you write inside the switch body but *outside* a case's own region — a stray
    statement, or a case you added by hand without regenerating — is not preserved. From the moment
    you tag it, the structure around the case regions belongs to Pinfit, exactly as everywhere else.

## Tagging a switch you already wrote

You do not have to start from an empty switch. The first time you tag an existing hand-written one:

- code already inside a `case` whose label **matches** an enum member is migrated into that
  member's new region rather than discarded;
- a `case` whose label **does not match** any member is left alone, and generation fails with a
  clear error instead of silently dropping it — fix or remove that case, then generate again.

## Resolving the enum

Pinfit looks for the named type in two places, in order:

1. **Every `enums:` block declared anywhere in the project's `.module.yaml` and `.interface.yaml`
   files.** If it is there, the case list is taken straight from the spec and nothing else happens.
2. **The project's `.h` and `.c` files**, scanned for a matching
   `typedef enum { ... } flash_opcodes_t;`. Because this is a guess about your source, Pinfit shows
   what it found and asks you to confirm before using it:

```console
@PinfitSwitch flash_opcodes_t is not declared in any YAML enums: block.
Found a matching 'typedef enum' in drivers/flash_regs.h:
  FLASH_OP_READ, FLASH_OP_WRITE, FLASH_OP_ERASE
Use this enum? [y/N]:
```

!!! info "The fallback scan is deliberately simple"

    It matches a single `typedef enum { ... } name;` and splits members on commas — it is not a C
    preprocessor. Two files defining the same enum name with different members make generation
    fail, naming both files; a body that builds its members from macros is not understood. Declare
    the enum in a YAML `enums:` block if you hit either.

## What gets remembered

Once you confirm an enum found by the file scan, Pinfit records **where it is declared** — never a
copy of it. It adds an entry to the `externalEnums:` block of the `.module.yaml` that owns the file
containing the `@PinfitSwitch`, with `file` relative to that YAML:

```yaml title="drivers/flash.module.yaml"
externalEnums:
  - { name: flash_opcodes_t, file: ../drivers/flash_regs.h }
```

This is a **link, not a declaration**. Unlike `enums:`, Pinfit never emits its own `typedef` for an
`externalEnums:` entry — the type already exists in `file`, and redeclaring it would conflict with
or duplicate the real definition. Later runs read `file` directly to get the case list, with no
project scan and no repeated question.

The entry is written as a plain text insertion, the same way `enums:` entries are: the rest of the
file, comments included, is untouched, and the result is verified by re-parsing and rolled back if
that fails.

!!! note "Only modules can remember"

    `externalEnums:` exists on `.module.yaml` only. A `@PinfitSwitch` inside a file owned by a
    state machine, observer, command table or adapter spec will ask for confirmation **every**
    time. Declare the enum in YAML `enums:` if that becomes tiresome.

## When to use it

| Situation | Better tool |
| --- | --- |
| Reacting to opcodes from a wire protocol you own | [Command table](../generators/command-table.md) — it generates the whole dispatcher. |
| Reacting to events that change a mode or state | [State machine](../generators/state-machine.md). |
| Exhaustively handling a vendor enum, a register map, or an error code list inside one function | `@PinfitSwitch`. |
