# CLI reference

Run `pinfit` from the project directory or any of its descendants. To run the plain release jar on
your own Java 17+ instead of the installed bundle, substitute `java -jar path/to/pinfit-<version>.jar` for `pinfit` everywhere below.

```console
pinfit --help
```

```title="Usage"
Pinfit - YAML-driven C interface and module generator

Usage: pinfit <command> [options]

Commands:
  init             Create a new pinfit.yaml project
  create           Scaffold a new interface, module, or other spec
  gen, generate    Generate C source from YAML specs
  rename           Rename a module and update every reference to it
  fix-prototypes   Add missing prototypes for hand-written functions
  detach           Remove Pinfit tags and generated-file tracking (destructive)

Run 'pinfit help <command>' or 'pinfit <command> --help' for details on a command,
and 'pinfit --version' for the installed version.
```

`pinfit`, `pinfit help` and `pinfit --help`/`-h` all print the command list above, with no flag detail.
For a given command, either `pinfit <command> --help`/`-h` or `pinfit help <command>` prints that
command's full usage and flags — the sections below. `pinfit --version` (or `-V`) prints the
installed version, e.g. `Pinfit 0.1.0`. Errors print a red `Pinfit error` block, usually
followed by a cyan hint explaining how to fix the spec.

The same reference is also shipped as a Unix `man` page, [`man/man1/pinfit.1`](https://github.com/daoek/Pinfit/blob/main/man/man1/pinfit.1)
in the repository. On a system with `man`, view it directly or install it:

```console
man ./man/man1/pinfit.1
# or, to make `man pinfit` work from anywhere:
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/man/man1 && cp man/man1/pinfit.1 ~/.local/share/man/man1/ && mandb
```

---

## `pinfit init`

```console
pinfit init [directory] [-f|--force]
```

Creates `pinfit.yaml` — and nothing else. Pinfit never chooses a source layout for you.

Without a directory it writes in the current one. It refuses to overwrite an existing `pinfit.yaml`
unless you pass `-f`.

See [Project configuration](../guide/project-configuration.md) for what the file contains.

---

## `pinfit create`

```console
pinfit create <kind> <name> [directory] [kind-specific options]
```

Writes a spec file into `directory`, creating that directory when needed. Without a directory it
writes in the current one. The scaffold arrives pre-filled with commented examples of every field.

| Kind | Command |
| --- | --- |
| [Interface](../generators/interface.md) | `pinfit create interface common_iic drivers/Interface` |
| [Module](../generators/module.md) | `pinfit create module ra_iic drivers/RA --implements common_iic` |
| [State machine](../generators/state-machine.md) | `pinfit create state-machine door [--engine builtin\|statesmith]` |
| [Observer](../generators/observer.md) | `pinfit create observer button_events --interface button_listener --capacity 8` |
| [Command table](../generators/command-table.md) | `pinfit create command-table uart_cmd` |
| [Status codes](../generators/status-codes.md) | `pinfit create status-codes pinfit_status` |
| [Adapter](../generators/adapter.md) | `pinfit create adapter bus_adapter --from bus --to bus_hal` |

### Options

| Option | Applies to | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--implements <name>[,<name>...]` | module | Interfaces the module implements. Comma-separated, no spaces. |
| `--interface <name>` | observer | The listener interface. Required. |
| `--capacity <n>` | observer | Maximum subscribers. |
| `--from <interface>` | adapter | The interface the adapter exposes. Required. |
| `--to <interface>` | adapter | The interface it calls into. Required. |
| `--dir <directory>` | all | The target directory, as an explicit flag instead of a positional argument. |

!!! note "Creating does not generate"

    `create` writes YAML only. Run `pinfit generate` to produce the C.

!!! warning "Not into a nested project"

    `pinfit create ... Lib/importedlib` is refused when that directory has its own `pinfit.yaml` — you
    would be writing a spec into another project, to be generated under the wrong rules. See
    [Nested projects](../guide/nested-projects.md).

---

## `pinfit generate`

```console
pinfit generate [directory] [-f|--force] [-v|--verbose] [--also-nested] [--strict]
pinfit gen [directory] ...
```

Scans the given directory tree (the current one by default), resolves every spec, and writes the
headers and sources. Interface references are resolved across the whole project, so specs can be
laid out however you like. `gen` is an alias.

```console
[##############################] 3/3  drivers\RA\ra_iic.c
3 file(s) generated
```

Generation is idempotent: running it twice produces identical files the second time. User regions
are carried across every run — see [User regions](../guide/user-regions.md).

### `-f`, `--force`

Overwrite files on disk that are **not** Pinfit-generated, or that were
[edited outside their user regions](../guide/user-regions.md#files-pinfit-will-not-overwrite-either-an-edit-outside-any-region),
instead of refusing.

!!! danger "This destroys hand-written content"

    Pinfit normally refuses to write over a file lacking its generated-file marker, which is what
    protects a hand-written `ra_iic.c` that predates the spec. `--force` removes that protection.
    Commit first.

### `-v`, `--verbose`

Replaces the progress bar with a per-file report of the project root, the scope, which spec produced
each output, whether it is new or regenerated, and how many user regions were carried over:

```console
Project root: D:\firmware
Scope: D:\firmware
[1/3] drivers\Interface\common_iic.interface.yaml -> drivers\Interface\common_iic_I.h (new file)
[2/3] drivers\RA\ra_iic.module.yaml -> drivers\RA\ra_iic.h (regenerated, no user regions found)
[3/3] drivers\RA\ra_iic.module.yaml -> drivers\RA\ra_iic.c (regenerated, 2 user region(s) carried over)
```

Use it when you want to confirm that your code was picked up, or to find which spec owns a file.

### `--also-nested`

Also generate every nested project found under the scanned directory, each with its own
`pinfit.yaml`. Asks for confirmation first, after a fast directory count.
[Full explanation](../guide/nested-projects.md#generating-everything-at-once-also-nested).

### `--strict`

Fails instead of warning when a non-`void` function falls back to a zero-initializer default -
same as [`strict: true`](../guide/project-configuration.md#strict) in `pinfit.yaml`, for one run.

---

## `pinfit rename module`

```console
pinfit rename module <old-name> <new-name>
```

Renames a module: its spec file and its generated header and source are moved, the references are
updated, and the project is regenerated in the same run.

```console
Moved drivers\RA\ra_iic.module.yaml -> drivers\RA\ra_iic_master.module.yaml
Moved drivers\RA\ra_iic.h -> drivers\RA\ra_iic_master.h
Moved drivers\RA\ra_iic.c -> drivers\RA\ra_iic_master.c
Renamed module 'ra_iic' to 'ra_iic_master'
3 file(s) generated
```

Use this rather than renaming files by hand: edited region content moves with the files, and
generated identifiers built from the module name are rebuilt consistently.

!!! note "Your own call sites are not rewritten"

    Code inside user regions, and code elsewhere in your project that calls the old
    `ra_iic_*` functions, is yours to update. The compiler will find them.

---

## `pinfit fix-prototypes`

```console
pinfit fix-prototypes [directory]
```

Scans every Pinfit-generated module source (`.c`) file in scope for functions you wrote directly
inside a usercode region that have no prototype anywhere in the file. This only catches plain
hand-written functions — a helper you added yourself, not part of any `.module.yaml` — since
YAML-spec'd module functions already get a prototype from Pinfit.

For each file with findings, it prints the function names and a unified diff (3 lines of context)
of the prototype(s) it would add to the `module.source.prototypes` usercode region at the top of
the file, then asks before writing anything:

```console
drivers\RA\ra_iic.c - 1 function(s) without a prototype:
  checksum

--- a/drivers\RA\ra_iic.c
+++ b/drivers\RA\ra_iic.c
@@ -14,6 +14,7 @@
 /*@Pinfit usercode-*/

 /*@Pinfit usercode+ module.source.prototypes*/
+static uint8_t checksum(const uint8_t *data, size_t length);
 /*@Pinfit usercode-*/

 /*@Pinfit(variable-definition:transfer_count)*/
Add these prototypes to the module.source.prototypes usercode region? [y/N]:
```

Answering anything but `y`/`yes` leaves that file untouched and moves on to the next one; the
command itself always exits `0` and reports how many prototypes were added, across how many files.

!!! note "Single-line signatures only"

    This is a line-based scan, not a C parser. A function signature split across multiple lines
    won't be recognized — keep the return type, name and parameter list on one line, brace on the
    next (or the same) line, as Pinfit's own generated functions do.

---

## `pinfit detach`

```console
pinfit detach
```

**Permanently** removes Pinfit from the project. It keeps all generated C code and unrelated YAML,
removes the Pinfit marker lines, then deletes `pinfit.yaml` and every Pinfit spec YAML
(`*.interface.yaml`, `*.module.yaml`, `*.state-machine.yaml`, `*.status-codes.yaml`,
`*.observer.yaml`, `*.command-table.yaml`, `*.adapter.yaml`), and the custom documentation YAML the
project referenced.

For an [`engine: statesmith`](../generators/state-machine.md#the-statesmith-engine) state machine,
the generated `.plantuml` is kept - only its Pinfit marker is stripped, as documentation - it is not
deleted like the YAML specs above.

```console
DESTRUCTIVE: detach Pinfit from this project
This removes all Pinfit tags and Pinfit-owned YAML configuration.
Generated C code and unrelated YAML files are kept.

Type the project name 'firmware' to continue:
```

You must type the exact project `name` from `pinfit.yaml`. Anything else cancels with nothing
changed.

!!! danger "There is no undo"

    A detached project cannot be regenerated unless it is configured again from scratch with
    `pinfit init`. Commit before running it.

Like `generate`, `detach` stops at nested projects: a vendored library with its own `pinfit.yaml` is
left fully intact.

---

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | A `Pinfit error` was printed — an invalid spec, a missing reference, a refused overwrite, an unreadable file — **or** a confirmation prompt was declined (`detach`, `--also-nested`). |
| `2` | A `Pinfit internal error` was printed: a bug in Pinfit itself, not in your specs. Set `PINFIT_DEBUG=1` and re-run to see the stack trace, and please [report it](https://github.com/daoek/Pinfit/issues). |

A declined confirmation is a non-zero exit deliberately, so a script that pipes `n` into
`pinfit generate --also-nested` does not report success for a run that generated nothing.
